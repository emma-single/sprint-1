What did I do well this week?

  Well, this week was hard for me. I got super behind due to work. Which was super frustrating. So I feel like I ended up having to rush things a little, which I do not like in the slightest!!!!!
  But I think the thing I did well this week was the fact that I at least tried to persevere. Particularly with my website. I didn't give up when it wasn't working, I kept going to make sure that I was doing it to the best of my current ability. It's definitely not where I want it to be yet, but I'm getting there. Slowly........

What could I have done to improve?

  My coding layout needs a big overhaul. I'm not 100% sure on the whole CSS layout, it's not particularly clear to me.

  And the whole making my site live thing, I'm really struggling with and I have no idea why. This I will have to keep going with.

  Blonde moments have been coming in hard this week, so I need to try and stop/improve that.
